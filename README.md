# ergodox_ez_keymap
My keymap for ergodox ez.  Made with QMK firmware.
This is my keymap.  I wish I could stop fiddling with it.


*Thanks to Erez Zukerman and his Ergodox EZ!*


**Highlights include:**

 - Coding characters have easy access in Layer 1.
- Alt Tab and Alt Shift Tab (program hopping) are easy and one handed.  See WNAV layer.
- Ctrl Tab and Ctrl Shift Tab (internal tab moving) are easy and one handed.  See WNAV layer.
- The A character is a Ctrl on long press.  Saves your pinky years of work.
- F keys mapped to number keys in  Layer 1.
- VIM Arrow keys, but also built like a pyramid if you want it.
- Volume UP/Down and Play/Pause and Next all easy to manipulate.
- A place to put hardcoded strings for frequently typed things, like email addresses, greetings, thank you messages.
- Dynamic Macros working if you want to not save other long strings.
